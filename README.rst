Test-Driven Django Development
==============================

This repository contains code and tutorials used to lead a Test-driven Django
workshop. These were developed by `San Diego Python`_ and used for a full day
event where anyone interested can come and learn `Django`_.

The code is not meant as a replacement for the (excellent) `Django tutorials`_
but rather intended to provide additional insight and knowledge.
It is best if users go through the tutorials and understand the absolute basics
of Django before the workshop.
