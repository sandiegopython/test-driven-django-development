Experiences with the tutorials
==============================

November 2, 2013 San Diego Workshop
-----------------------------------

We did a Django TDD workshop on November 2, 2013 in San Diego based on these
tutorials (`version 0.0.1`_)

Teaching Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We split into 5 groups at large tables, ensuring a reasonable mix of users
that were new and experienced at programming/webdev/Django/TDD.  Each user
walked through the tutorials at their own pace.  Four of us floated around
the room answering questions and noting everyone's place in the tutorials.

Most hang-ups were experienced by multiple tables independently.  When an issue
was found with the tutorials, one of us would start drafting a pull request
(to improve clarity or fix a bug).  We usually merged the pull requests after
at least one other volunteer reviewed it We asked anyone else who had the
issue to refresh the page and see whether the new copy clarified their issue.

Everyone finished the tutorials in about 5 hours.

Participant Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The feedback was very positive.  The primary negative feedback I remember was
that some occasionally felt like they were just copy-pasting.  I think this
could be resolved by adding some more explanation for some sections and
encouraging users not to copy-paste (as suggested by Learn Python the Hard
Way).  One user also noted that he often forgot to go look at the site after
adding a feature.  We should probably ask users to go inspect the relevant
part of the site whenever their tests pass.
